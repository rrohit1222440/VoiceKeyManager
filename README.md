VaultVoice is a secure desktop password manager that offers a unique dual-authentication experience using either voice recognition or an image puzzle. Users can choose to log in by speaking a custom phrase (e.g., “unlock my vault”) or by selecting a secret 3-part sequence on a shuffled image grid. During sign-up, users upload their own image and select their secret pattern, which is stored locally for future authentication. All login credentials are safely stored offline using SQLite, ensuring both security and privacy.

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Then simply run main.py to launch the application. Upon launching, users are prompted to select their login method—voice or image puzzle. If the user chooses the puzzle login but hasn’t signed up yet, the app will prompt them to upload an image and select a pattern. Once authenticated, the user can add new passwords, view saved credentials, and manage everything within the secure VaultVoice dashboard.

This project is built using Python’s Tkinter for the graphical interface, Pillow for image processing, and the SpeechRecognition and sounddevice libraries for handling voice input.
